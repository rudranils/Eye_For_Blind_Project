# Eye for Blind Capstone Project

## Problem Statement
In this project, we will be converting image to text description first and then using a simple text to speech API so that the extracted text description/caption will be converted to audio. So the central part of this capstone is focused on building the caption/text description. As the second part, we are transforming the text to speech with the text to speech API.
